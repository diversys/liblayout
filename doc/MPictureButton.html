An MPictureButton is liblayout's version of BPictureButton. Like MButton, it
works asynchronous, meaning is does not keep the window
locked when you keep the mousebutton pressed down on it. It serves as a base-class for MRew, MPlayBW, MStop, MPlayFW, MFFWD
and MEject.

<PRE>
      MPictureButton(minimax <I>size</I>,
         BPicture *<I>off</I>, 
         BPicture *<I>on</I>, 
         BMessage *<I>message</I> = NULL, 
         BHandler *<I>target</I> = NULL, 
         uint32 <I>behavior</I> = B_ONE_STATE_BUTTON) 
</PRE>
<P>
Since the size of a picture cannot be determined, you <B>must</B> specify
a size for this control, and this size should be <B>fixed</B>.
You specify the pictures for the pressed/unpressed state with the <I>on</I>
and <I>off</I> arguments. You can specify the <I>message</I> that the control
should send when clicked, as well as a <I>target</I> for this message.
Finally, you can set the <I>behavior</I> to either B_ONE_STATE_BUTTON
or B_TWO_STATE_BUTTON. A one-state button displays the <I>off</I> image
normally and the <I>on</I> image to highlight the button when it's clicked.
A two-state button toggles between the <I>off</I> image and the <I>on</I> image
<P>
When the button has been activated and it's time to call BInvoker::Invoke(), MPictureButton will add a boolean called
M_DOUBLECLICK to the message. When this boolean is true, the button was doubleclicked.<BR>
It also adds an int32 called M_BUTTON_MASK to the message, which indicates with which mousebuttons the MPictureButton
was clicked.
<P>
<B>See also:  </B>the BPictureButton constructor.
