An MButton is a BButton which has been adapted to be a part of layoutlib, and has been enhanced in such a way that it doesn't keep the window locked if you keep the button pressed. In all other respects,
an MButton works just like a BButton. For further information about BButtons, you are encouraged to read the BeBook.

<PRE>
      MButton(const char *<I>label</I>, BMessage <I>*message</I>, BHandler <I>*target</I>=NULL, minimax <I>size</I>=minimax(-1,-1,65536,65536,1))
      MButton(const char *<I>label</I>, ulong <I>ID</I>, minimax <I>size</I>=minimax(-1,-1,65536,65536,1))
</PRE>
<P>
Initializes an MButton that will display the label <I>label</I>.<BR>
The first form of the constructor will assign the model <I>message</I> to the button, and set up the <I>target</I> BHandler as the target for this message.<BR>
The second form of the constructor will create a BMessage(M_BUTTON_SELECTED), which will contain a pointer to the button (whose name is defined by the constant M_BUTTON_POINTER), and an int32 (called M_BUTTON_ID)
that has the value <I>ID</I>. <BR>
The MButton's size can be constrained with the <I>size</I> argument.
<P>
When the button has been activated and it's time to call BInvoker::Invoke(), MButton will add a boolean called
M_DOUBLECLICK to the message. When this boolean is true, the button was doubleclicked.
It also adds an int32 called M_BUTTON_MASK to the message, which indicates with which mousebuttons the MButton
was clicked.
