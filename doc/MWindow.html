An MWindow is really just a BWindow, even the constructor is exactly the same. The only difference between
an MWindow and a BWindow is that an MWindow handles the resizing of its content for you, as well as
color-drops from roColour and Beatware Painter.<BR>
If you derive from MWindow and implement your own MessageReceived, remember to call inherited::MessageReceived().

ulong flags
<UL>
The <I>flags</I> member is used to customize the behaviour of the MWindow. The following
flags are defined (and can be logically OR'ed together):<BR>
<B>M_USE_CALCULATED_MINX</B> The minimum width of the window equals the minimum width of the top view. Set by default.<BR>
<B>M_USE_CALCULATED_MINY</B> The minimum height of the window equals the minimum height of the top view. Set by default.<BR>
<B>M_USE_CALCULATED_MAXX</B> The maximum width of the window equals the maximum width of the top view.<BR>
<B>M_USE_CALCULATED_MAXY</B> The maximum height of the window equals the maximum height of the top view.<BR>
<B>M_WIN_AUTORESIZE</B> The MWindow will make sure its first child fills the entire window. Set by default.<BR>
</UL>
<HR>
An MWindow will normally determine its size-limits from the limits of its first view. If you unset the M_WIN_AUTORESIZE flag, you must do a number of things yourself:<UL>
	<LI> you must make sure that the highest-level MViews are MBorders
	<LI> you must set the resizing mode of the MBorders
	<LI> if the resizing mode is not B_FOLLOW_NONE, you must set the B_FRAME_EVENTS flag of these MBorders
	<LI> you must give the MBorders an initial size and position in the window
	<LI> <B>you must calculate and set the window's size-limits yourself.</B>
</UL><P>
For example, to use a layoutable view in a document window with scrollbars, you would do something like:<pre>   mwindow->AddChild(mborder);
   mwindow->flags&=(~M_WIN_AUTORESIZE);
   mborder->SetResizingMode(B_FOLLOW_ALL);
   mborder->SetFlags(bview->Flags()|B_FRAME_EVENTS);
   minimax limit=topview->layoutprefs();
   mwindow->SetSizeLimits(limit.mini.x+B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH,1E6,limit.mini.y+B_H_SCROLL_BAR_HEIGHT,1E6);
   BRect wb=mwindow->Bounds();
   mborder->ResizeTo(wb.Width()-B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH,wb.Height()-B_H_SCROLL_BAR_HEIGHT);</pre>
Note that the same technique can be used to put layoutable views in a plain BWindow, and to have multiple layoutable 
classes as direct descentdants of a window. You should set the window-limits <B>before</B> calling Show(), so the Show()
can validate the current window-size against the imposed limits, and adjust the size if required.

(I might get around to explaining the constructor here, but until then, use the BeBook: the constructor
for an MWindow equals that of a BWindow, and an MWindow is functionally equivalent to a BWindow (except that
it knows how to resize its contents, and knows what to do when you drop a color on it from roColour or
Beatware Painter).
