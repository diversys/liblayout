<H1>The Layout Library:  Questions & Answers</H1>
Library: <B>liblayout.so</B>
<P>

<H4>Liblayout feels a little slow. Why?</H4>
<P>
Liblayout uses a BView for every control and group, and using
lots of BViews slows down the windowing system somewhat. As of
R4 resizing speed has been improved somewhat, but complex windows
may still feel a little sluggish on slow machines.<BR>
Counterquestion: do you spend much time resizing windows?
<P>
<H4>Why does the rotating volume-button (MVolume class) have two operating modes?</H4>
<P>
Because I like the "linear" behaviour (which is the default), while others
expect the "radial" behaviour. The mode that a user prefers seems to be based
mostly on past experiences with application utilising such buttons. As people
from many different backgrounds have embraced the BeOS, it seemed like a good
idea to allow users to customize the behaviour of this nonstandard button.
<P>
<H4>Why does the tabbed view have two different appearances?</H4>
<P>
The "full width" mode was the original mode. Don't ask me why, it's just how I
implemented it. Other people who made tabbed views seemed to prefer a
left-aligned display, so I added two lines of code to make this possible as
well.
<P>
<H4>Why can each window have a different set of fonts?</H4>
<P>
There are three system-wide font-settings for "plain", "bold" and "fixed" font,
which are supposed to apply to applications throughout the system. In practice,
the "Terminal" application is the first application to break with this, since it
uses its own setting, instead of using the default fixed font. Also, there is
another setting (settable with another application, no less) for the menu-font.
But I digress...<BR>
The reason that each window can have a different setting is the existence of
FontSelector. The first version of FontSelector could only broadcast fontchanges
to the entire system. A later version added to ability to drag-and-drop fonts.
When dropping a font onto a window of an application, it proved to be
counter-intuitive to let that change apply to the entire application, changing
the font for <I>all</I> windows of the application. That's why it is now
possible to drop a font onto a window of a liblayout-application, and have only
the font for that particular window change.
<P>
<H4>Isn't liblayout starting to be like MUI?</H4>
<P>
I don't think so.<BR>
The goal of liblayout is not to make the GUI totally customizable. I
will add configurability where it makes sense, but don't expect to be able to
have scroll-lists with background-patterns, and buttons that look like they
were carved from marble (note: as of R4, BeOS provides a standard mechanism for
using images as backgrounds for views).<BR>
The goal of liblayout was and is to make it easier for developers to create
font-sensitive and resizable GUI's.
