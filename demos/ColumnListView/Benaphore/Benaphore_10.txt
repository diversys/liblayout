Description: A signal-safe implementation of a Benaphore.
Notes: This is an implementation of a Benaphore class (see issue #26 of the Be Newsletter <http://www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue26.html> or the BeOS Kernel Kit API <http://www.be.com/documentation/be_book/kernel/sems.html#Benaphores). The API is similar to Chris Herborth's Benaphore class, with an added bonus of being signal-safe (which the original Benaphores were not).
