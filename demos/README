These are some simple applications to help you get started
using liblayout. They don't actually do anything useful, they
just display windows with stuff in them. For an example that
 actually does something, please refer to the SoundPlay
plugin SDK, which contains sourcecode for a "mixer" plugin
that uses liblayout for its UI.
