<H1>The Layout Library, release 1.4.0</H1>

<H2>What is it?</H2>
The Layout Libary (liblayout) is an award winning shared library that allows programmers to quickly 
and easily create fully font-sensitive and/or resizable GUI's for their 
programs. liblayout also supports color-drops from applications such as
<A HREF="http://www.rodesign.com">roDesign</A>'s
roColour and
<A HREF="http://www.beatware.com">Beatware</A>'s Painter, and it supports font-drops from FontSelector or any
other application that uses <A HREF="http://www.angryredplanet.com/~hackbod/">Dianne Hackborn</A>'s FFont class for storing fonts in BMessages.
<P>
