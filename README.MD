# The Layout Library, release 1.4.1

## What is it?

The Layout Libary (liblayout) is an award winning shared library that allows programmers to quickly and easily create fully font-sensitive and/or resizable GUI's for their programs. liblayout also supports color-drops from applications such as [roDesign](http://www.rodesign.com)'s roColour and [Beatware](http://www.beatware.com)'s Painter, and it supports font-drops from FontSelector or any other application that uses [Dianne Hackborn](http://www.angryredplanet.com/~hackbod/)'s FFont class for storing fonts in BMessages.
