An MBViewWrapper is a wrapper-class for a standard BView. By attaching a standard 
BView to an MBViewWrapper, the BView can participate in the layout-process, without
being a layoutable class itself.<BR>
Although this is a simple method of making <I>any</I> BView participate, it does have
one disadvantage: it adds a little more overhead, as there are now two BViews (the wrapper and your own BView), where there would otherwise have been only one.

      MBViewWrapper(BView *<I>bview</I>, bool <I>usepreferred</I>=true, bool <I>x_fixed</I>=true, bool <I>y_fixed</I>=true)
</PRE>
<P>
Initializes an MBViewWrapper that will contain the BView <i>view</I><BR>
If <I>usepreferred</I> is true, <I>view</I> will be queried through its <B>GetPreferredSize()</I> memberfunction for its preferred size. This size will be used as the minimum
size. If <I>usepreferred</I> is false, then the minimum size of <I>view</I> will be
equal to the size with which it was constructed.<BR>
If <I>x_fixed</I> is true <B>and <I>bview's</I>resizing mode does not include B_FOLLOW_LEFT_RIGHT</B>, the size of the object will be fixed in the horizontal
direction, and will be equal to its minimum size.<BR>
If <I>y_fixed</I> is true <B>and <I>bview's</I>resizing mode does not include B_FOLLOW_TOP_BOTTOM</B>, the size of the object will be fixed in the vertical
direction, and will be equal to its minimum size.
<P>
<B>Note that the x_fixed and y_fixed arguments are essentially obsolete. If you use their
default values, you can control the resizing behaviour of the view by setting its 
resizing mode.</B>
