<H1>The Layout Library:  MApplication</H1>

An MApplication is really just a BApplication, even the constructor is exactly the same. The only difference between
an MApplication and a BApplication is that an MApplication understands messages broadcasted by FontSelector,
which it will forward to the windows it owns.<BR>
If you derive from MApplication and implement your own MessageReceived, remember to call inherited::MessageReceived().

<H3><A NAME="MApplication()">MApplication()</A></H3>
<P>
(I might get around to explaining the constructor here, but until then, use the BeBook: the constructor
for an MApplication equals that of a BApplication, and an MApplication is functionally equivalent to a BApplication (except that it knows how to handle fontchange-broadcasts).
